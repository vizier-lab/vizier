# Specification Quality Checklist: Prune old tool outputs, recall them on demand

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-008 resolved: pruning is on for every conversation from the start, no switch.
- The spec names the tool (`recall_history`), its category (`history`) and the placeholder text,
  because the user specified them and the agent sees them; these are the feature's interface, not
  implementation choices. Prompt caching and telemetry are named as the outcomes the feature must
  preserve and report, without naming how.
